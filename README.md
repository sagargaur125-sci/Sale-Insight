# Sale-Insight
In this project, I began by importing a company's dataset, detailing products sold and sales across various zones, into SQL. Using a local server, I connected and integrated the data into Power BI. 

From there, I developed an interactive and dynamic dashboard that provides key sales insights, such as:
- Top 5 Best-Selling Products.
- Zones Generating the Highest Revenue.

The dashboard can be used for data-driven decision-making by highlighting actionable insights. For example:
- Identifying cities where focused advertising can maximize revenue.
- Pinpointing high-performing products and regions to allocate resources effectively.

 The dashboard enables businesses to identify growth opportunities, optimize marketing efforts in underperforming areas, and enhance overall decision-making to boost revenue and performance.
